## Info
This project used to be a CLI program that checked for user error but did not implement methods and used for loops instead. 
In this update (Jan 2025) when setting out to create a GUI for this I encountered a plethora of bugs when trying to modify the
old code and essentially ended up starting from scratch. The only piece of old logic that I kept were the question switch cases,
which themselves had to be modified and moved.
This is my first project in which I converted an old CLI program to a GUI app it was far more difficult than I envisioned.
This tested my patience the most out of any project I have built so far as I kept squashing and making bugs for what seemed to be hours, 
and having to go through trial and error many times as I teach myself how the Swing library works.





## Next Steps
### I hope to keep expanding on this project! Here are my ideas on what to add...
1. [x] Implement a Colored UI + Custom Fonts
2. [x] Add progress Bar **WIP**
3. [ ] Add slider for the user to customize number of questions asked **WIP**
4. [ ] Increase question pool size
5. [ ] Create an ALL trivia option where questions are pulled from the entire pool
